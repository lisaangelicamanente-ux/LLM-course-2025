        "* You will learn how to download a pre-trained model and a training dataset from Hugging Face.\n",
        "* You will learn how to fine-tune the downloaded model with the dataset using Hugging Face trl library and the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) method.\n",
        "* You will learn how to use the fine-tuned model to generate text based on user input / prompts.\n",
        "* You will learn how to upload the fine-tuned model to your own Hugging Face repository so that it can be used later or shared with other users.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prerequistes\n",
        "* You will need the following free accounts: Google, Hugging Face and Weights & Biases. You may use your existing accounts or create new accounts for the purposes of this course.\n",
        "* We will use the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) libraries: transformers (for models), datasets (for datasets), trl (for training). We will also store the fine-tuned models in a Hugging Face repository.\n",
        "* Training is done using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which provides free access to Jupyter notebooks backed with a GPU compute required for fine-tuning.\n",
